        We curate our solutions to games using algorithms that are gauranteed to help
        you win. Since the  1950s, academia has extensively studied and improved upon
        game theory â€” mathematical models of strategic interactions used in analyzing
        and dealing with competitive situations or games. A game&apos;s outcome is
        critically dependent on it&apos;s players&apos; choice of actions. Our service
        helps you make the best possible choices to maximize the chance for favorable
        outcomes in your games.
      </Typography>
      <Typography className={bem('description')} variant="body1" component="div">
        Our algorithms are gathered directly from the community through message
        boards, scholarly articles, and more. We can ensure that our clients recieve
        the best possible service by handpicking community solutions that have been
        tested and approved by many. Game Breaker exclusively provides client-side
        processing solutions, so it is necessary that our algorithms remain performant
        considering some clients&apos; limited access to resources like computer memory
        and processing power.
